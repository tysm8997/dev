        	<p>My Dearest Git, you are the versioning control system of my dreams. The days of copy and paste are a thing of the past with your easy to use configuration. Thanks to Linus Torvalds, you keep track of the changes I make to files so that I dont have to. We have such a long, documented history. We always crossed paths in the terminal, and once I got the language barrier we were a match. I was always able to go back and fix my mistakes with you with the super undo. I am still learning how to navigate all of your different branches, but I can tell that this function will be useful once I master it. You kept a log of all the times we talked, every single time. Once I cracked your code, there was no turning back.
        </p>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>Tyler</p>

          <p>We only just met, but you have made life so much easier for me. I remember the first time I saw you in the terminal, and you taught me your different command line prompts. At the end of that first session I typed exit and was gone in a hurry. You taught me so many different things. You used 'pwd' and showed me my present working directory. With 'ls', you listed the contents and changed your directory with 'cd'

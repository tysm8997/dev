          <p>We only just met, but you have made life so much easier for me. I remember the first time I saw you in the terminal, and you taught me your different command line prompts. At the end of that first session I typed exit and was gone in a hurry. You taught me so many different things. You used 'pwd' and showed me my present working directory. With 'ls', you listed the contents and changed your directory with 'cd'. We can go up and dow and even toggle between the last two directories. When we touch we create files, we even had a test.html. I had to make new directories, or mkdir for short. You were difficult when directories had two names, but you made up with it when you taught me cheats (like dragging a folder onto the terminal window). Life isn't always easy, but with you lifes a little better.

        <p>Love,</p>
